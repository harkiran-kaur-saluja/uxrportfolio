                <h4>research overview</h4>
                <p>KidsTeam is an <strong className = "bolded-words">intergenerational co-design team</strong> that is comprised of children ages 7-11 years old, adult design partners, and sometimes various outside stakeholders (this can be industry partners such as Amazon, local partners such as the Seattle Public Library, or other universities such as USC). At KidsTeam, we engage in <strong className = "bolded-words">participatory design practices</strong> in which the children are equal stakeholders throughout the design process.</p>
                <p>For two and a half years, I have been studying participatory design with children as part of KidsTeam UW under Professor Jason Yip. KidsTeam UW's research is part of the Information School (iSchool) at the University of Washington and we <strong className = "bolded-words">aim to understand the interactions with and perceptions of technology through co-design sessions, interviews, and qualitative coding of rich data</strong>, which further informs our approach to designing technologies with input from (and built for) children. I have worked on a variety of projects with several partners, including Amazon, Google, SunSmart, and other departments at UW.</p>

                <h4>takeaways: what I learned</h4>
                <p>Prior to KidsTeam, I had no knowledge of the research process or even research in general. I had worked with children prior to this experience and was interested in HCI, hence my interest in Professor Yipâ€™s work. Throughout the two and a half years, I got to understand the process and ethics of user research and work on various projects that resulted in me being the co-author of three academic papers as an undergraduate. It is important to give attention to participants in the co-design process, as they are crucial stakeholders. I also learned how to collect, process, and qualitatively analyze data, as well as conduct semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, I was able to grasp the literature review and paper writing process. Overall, this experience enabled me to pursue HCI education and UX research in the future and it set the foundation for my UX research career. </p>
