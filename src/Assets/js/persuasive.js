                <p><strong>executive summary </strong></p>
                <blockquote>Ugh, I have so much work to do. I'm so stressed out and I never seem to catch a break from all of these assignments.</blockquote>
                <p>This is a statement often overheard in many discussions among college students. Most of our lives depend on our ability to do our work. While there is a wealth of research on work, there is no universal work strategy, and by extension, there is no universal method of taking breaks. Our project is meant to help people better their productivity and mental health by encouraging them to take a healthy amount of breaks. Being college students ourselves, we decided to take on the task of finding a novel way in which college students might be motivated to find the right balance between work and play. The end result is Balance, a social mobile app that encourages students to nominate their friends for fun mini-challenges and dares that they can participate in during their break times. This app utilizes the persuasive techniques of self-affirmation and social proof.</p>
                

                <p><strong>background research</strong></p>


                <p><u>literature review</u></p>
                <p>To start off, we conducted a <strong>literature review</strong> of eleven academic papers that spanned topics relating to taking breaks, stress, self-esteem, workaholism, health, and screen time. Here are some findings from this process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Participants were asked to embark on small tasks with varying levels of frustration, and those who completed the tasks were more willing to take breaks than either participants who had done an easier task or those who failed to complete the frustrating task.</li>
                    <li>We build a somewhat stable form of self-esteem in our foundational years which stays with us through all the different transitions in life and people with low self-esteem are more prone to mental health issues like depression.</li>
                    <li>Excessive screen time use is associated with increased amounts of stress.</li>
                    <li>Appeals to dynamic norms (changes in the ways in which people/peers are acting) can foster behavior change, even if the new behaviors violate current norms.</li>
                    <li>Primary reasons given for taking breaks were tiredness, boredom, hunger or thirst, poor concentration, the need to rest, and to socialize. Participants listed several reasons as to why they did not take mental breaks, such as time, workloads, deadlines, and the task being almost completed.</li>
                    <li>The reasons for why people took breaks can be categorized into one&rsquo;s personal state and potential activity. There is a relationship between the frequency and time taking breaks with one&rsquo;s overall approach to time structure and procrastination, as well as self-esteem.</li>
                    <li>Timely reminders are effective in prompting users to take breaks from sitting. Solutions for this should involve the user having control over their behavior and should support the user rather than distract them.</li>
                </ul>

                
                <p><u>expert consults</u></p>
                <p>The experts we chose to interview included Mark Seery, a social psychologist from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York; Kai Crosson, a Department of Energy research psychologist in their human resources department; and Eric James, a researcher at the Metropolitan State University in Denver studying organizational communication (watched his TED Talk). Through these consults, we hoped to get a better understanding of how self-affirmation and social proof may help people&rsquo;s relationships with work. Our main goal was to change how people see their work and breaks by using the principles these experts study.</p>
                
                <p>key findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mark Seery studies how people deal with stress. We wanted his perspective on people&rsquo;s states when doing stressful work. He agreed that social proof could be used to reduce stress, and he pointed to the idea that a possible avenue of social proof would be dynamic norms.
                        <ul>
                            <li>By saying that some percentage of one&rsquo;s friends are just starting to do something, it still holds the social proof that their friends are doing something, but it makes the goal feel less challenging because people are only just starting. This response significantly bolstered our hope that social proof could work.</li>
                            <li>A dynamic social norm can only encourage behavior change if people view the norm as likely to endure; if people view the changed norm as a brief fad, behavior is unlikely to change.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Kai Crosson endorsed norms as a powerful idea as well, directing us to investigate normative and informational norms.
                        <ul>
                            <li>She did have a lot of hope for our self-affirmation ideas and reflected on the ways that self-affirmation can protect against different types of identity threats, which can improve their ability to feel successful in their work and their breaks.</li>
                            <li>With breaks, she had the insight that people do not see breaks as a reward for any sort of hard work. They see the break only as a stoppage point for the reward of finishing a task. For this reason, we wanted to reframe the break as the beneficial act, not the finishing of a task.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Eric James&rsquo;s TED Talk allowed us to gain a perspective from outside the psychology field and bring in a societal perspective.
                        <ul>
                            <li>He argues that unfortunately, many people identify as their job. This can be dangerous because it means that our only role in life is how we fit into society and the pressure could be a cause of workaholism.</li>
                            <li>Our self-concept can be reframed to be curious about ourselves and others in terms of who we are as people, not as workers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>From our expert consults, we were able to confirm that social proof and self-affirmation are two powerful ways to engage with people and their relationships with work. We learned however, that the type of affirmation matters because out of context affirmation can make the affirming properties less effective.</p>
            
                <p><strong>focus group and user interviews</strong></p>
                <p><u>focus group</u></p>
                <p>We conducted a 30-minute <strong>virtual focus group</strong> with 12 members of our target population, college students. In our session, we used an activity designed to reveal people&rsquo;s perspectives – their thoughts, feelings, needs, wishes, etc. – using metaphors. This activity was called <a href="http://imaginari.es/new-metaphors/">New Metaphors</a>. We formulated a set of 5 concepts related to our project topic, which we intended to utilize to surface participants&rsquo; metaphorical associations. These 5 concepts were: using a screen for work versus play, peer influence, refreshing the mind, taking breaks, and wellness and productivity. Something that helped us narrow down our main concepts was the technique of</p>
                <p>writing down our individual ideas on sticky notes for a few minutes and then putting them all on a common whiteboard (see below). After this, we grouped them into the 5 main categories that we defined as our concepts and send each of our participants a consent form along with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mQ-AW05mK92LIsKqA62JnGVi8sI3vEDQqBIGfLRiqbE/edit">New Metaphors slides,</a> where they were instructed to identify up to 5 metaphors that resonated the most with how they think about or experience the concept in question.</p>
                <p>During the focus group, we managed to facilitate a conversation about each of the specific concepts we asked participants to reflect on in the New Metaphors exercise. Additionally, we invited participants to share their chosen metaphors and elaborate on the reasons for their choices, as well as offer feedback and ask questions of other participants as well.</p>
                <p>key findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With regard to using screens for work and entertainment, we noticed that several participants chose &ldquo;a balancing act&rdquo; as their metaphorical association. The rationale behind this was relatively consistent between participants: they felt that they must achieve a &ldquo;balance&rdquo; between using the same screen for work and play.
                        <ul>
                            <li>A few participants described using screens for entertainment provided them with easy access to quick mental breaks.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>People often mentioned that their friends influenced their breaks as opposed to random people who they have no relation with. They might feel good/ guilty about breaks depending on what the other person/ people are doing.
                        <ul>
                            <li>When a group of people work together, it only takes one person to influence the entire group to take a break, but it doesn&rsquo;t work the other way around; it&rsquo;s not easy for one person to convince the entire group to get back to work.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Nature seemed to be a common metaphor for participants&rsquo; concepts of &ldquo;refreshing their minds.&rdquo; Specific nature-related examples like walking in the woods, soaking in the sunlight and taking long walks seemed to make them feel more present and in the moment.
                        <ul>
                            <li>At a higher-level, several of our participants described &ldquo;refreshing the mind&rdquo; to provide them with clarity and new perspectives with regard to tasks and work.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Participants described breaks as ways to move forward and enhance their productivity, outlining that they understand that breaks are helpful. It was heartening to hear that the participants were aware that breaks from screen time enhance their productivity rather than inhibit it.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The other topic in which participants engaged was the idea of guilt -- that breaks should not be taken because of some moral obligation to their work, as if the work is a governing factor in their lives. For instance, even when taking a break, participants reported continuing to think about work.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>For the most part, participants strongly linked the two concepts of wellness and productivity, detailing that without taking care of oneself, it is impossible to be productive. They pointed out ideas as simple as a headache getting in the way of them reading and writing and as grand as their overall wellness of body and mind being the key to the quality of their work.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not all participants, however, immediately linked the two. These participants did not feel that wellness impacted their productivity. They expressed an interest in &ldquo;wellness activities&rdquo; but did not report that they engaged in them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>how this impacts the design of our solution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>People don't want to be told what to do, especially during their break time. They want their breaks to be just that – a break from work pressures, canvas to-dos, and pressurizing managers.</li>
                    <li>Why don't people take breaks? Because they think their work is more important than their health. Because they're unable to see the big picture and plan for well-being. Or because they think their self-worth is linked to their work/ productivity. How do we help people break out of this cycle of constantly working without breaks?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We thought it might be beneficial to <strong>hit refresh and reframe</strong> the way we're currently thinking about our project. Instead of encouraging people to take breaks, why not help them break out of this &ldquo;workaholism?&rdquo; This might help us bring in richer research insights and ultimately design something completely new!</p>
                

                <p><u>user interviews</u></p>
                <p>Our team was focused on facilitating behavior change that reduces &ldquo;workaholic&rdquo; behaviors, and we defined work habits that erode one&rsquo;s mental and/or physical health, ultimately making the person less productive at work. As our team aims to help &ldquo;workaholic&rdquo; university students take breaks from screen-based work, our 7 semi-structured user interviews sought to identify the pain points and habits of university students related to work and breaks.</p>
                <p>We first crafted an extensive list of interview questions for university students (that you can see below in our interview notes) that helped us to probe our future users&rsquo; most substantial challenges related to school work and time management. After our focus group activity, we refined our interview questions in light of our discoveries regarding users&rsquo; perceptions of schoolwork, mindfulness, and breaks.</p>
                <p>Below, see each question we included in our revised semi-structured interviews and our rationale for its inclusion.</p>
                <p>pain points:</p>
                <p>The most common pain points reported by the university students were connected: <strong>time management</strong>, <strong>school-life balance</strong>, and <strong>stress</strong>.</p>
                <p>Nearly all of our participants reported struggles with time management. The struggle to optimize use of time came primarily from substantial schoolwork demands. Most interviewees reported &ldquo;free flowing&rdquo; between work and breaks during work sessions, rather than planning breaks and the length of a work session prior to beginning work. Two interviewees reported using the &ldquo;Pomodoro method&rdquo; or planned chunks of work time broken up by breaks. The fact that most interviewees do not use planned work sessions and breaks raises the question of how we might communicate the benefits of our product and its associated work habits to users.</p>
                <p>Pain points related to school-life balance were commonly brought up by interviewees as well. Wanting to &ldquo;have a social life&rdquo;, &ldquo;get to know the people in my cohort better&rdquo;, and &ldquo;get 12 hours of sleep&rdquo; were unmet needs shared by our interviewees. When probed, the college students pointed to school demands as the reason for which these needs were not met. As socializing with others and getting sufficient sleep are necessary for one to be healthy and productive, these unmet needs appear appropriate for our team to target with our intervention.</p>
                <p>We also noticed interviewees report that when they lack time to do schoolwork (when they are in a time crunch), they tend to view assignments merely as &ldquo;to-dos&rdquo; rather than as learning opportunities. For example, if an interviewed med student felt pressed for time to study for a test, he would view the ends of studying as &ldquo;doing well on the test&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;being a better doctor.&rdquo; This raises the question of whether values affirmation or long-term goal pursuit could reframe students&rsquo; view of schoolwork.</p>
                <p>Every college student we asked about stress reported experiencing school/work-related stress. Common stressors included &ldquo;forgetting to do an assignment,&rdquo; &ldquo;feeling like I&rsquo;m not using enough of my time to work,&rdquo; &ldquo;a big test coming up,&rdquo; and &ldquo;putting effort into schoolwork but not seeing expected results.&rdquo; The causes of schoolwork-related stress that appear most able to be solved through our intervention are &ldquo;forgetting to do an assignment&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeling like I&rsquo;m not using enough of my time to work.&rdquo; We could use reminders and schedule features to help users remember when assignments are due. Similarly, if we have users plan break times and work times, we could alleviate concerns about lack of one&rsquo;s time invested into work. The limits of a persuasive intervention might be revealed in the pain point &ldquo;putting effort into schoolwork but not seeing expected results,&rdquo; unless we can find a way to communicate gains/progress being experienced by the user that the university is not currently using.</p>
                <p>key findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reflection on core values makes work feel purposeful</li>
                    <li>self-care and mindfulness activities make work feel approachable</li>
                    <li>students typically take free-flowing, spontaneous breaks during a work session and understand breaks as necessary for productivity</li>
                    <li>stress from work results from feeling &ldquo;not in control&rdquo;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In consideration of the findings above, we felt more confident that employing <strong>self-affirmation</strong> techniques may be a viable approach to enforcing healthier attitudes towards work and breaks. From our interviews, we found that reflecting on core values and passions allows work to feel more approachable and meaningful. This may increase students&rsquo; enjoyment of the work and prevent students from perceiving large amounts of work (or work in general) as a threat to ego and self-integrity. Moreover, we also found that students generally understand breaks as a necessary aspect of maintaining productivity. As a result, we hypothesized that by cultivating healthier perspectives of work through self-affirmation, we could better persuade students to stay committed to intermittent break sessions.</p>
                
                
                <p><strong>design process</strong></p>
                <p><br /><u>low-fidelity prototyping</u></p>
                <p><u> </u></p>
                <p>To kick off the prototyping stage, every member of the team created a low-fidelity prototype (some shown above) and tested our prototypes. We then took the insights we gained from our testing and created an affinity map (see below).</p>
                <p>After the discussion we had with experts and assessing the feedback we received, we were able to focus on using social proof as a means of demonstrating that since one&rsquo;s friends take breaks and that the action of break taking is a normal, socially acceptable practice, that the user should also take breaks. With that in mind, the biggest hurdle was employing social proof in a non-arduous, implicit manner. We eventually settled on being able to send challenges or funny activities, rather than our original idea of explicitly positive messages. This decision was immensely helpful because we were able to explore how we could embed affirming themes into the challenges.</p>
                <p>We also were able to think about how to demonstrate that taking breaks is the norm. While users may become accustomed to seeing their friends&rsquo; challenges, it is powerful to demonstrate that these norms are something that are dynamically and continually building up. For this reason, we thought about a gallery that would allow users to scroll through their favorite challenges that they completed. In this way, users could see their progress and joy in break taking. We also considered that users may not want to engage in a challenge in every break, but we still want to reinforce the positive potential of engaging in the app and taking breaks. This gallery could serve as an alternative to the challenge, simply allowing users to scroll through the ones they have already done.</p>
                


                <p><u>medium-fidelity prototyping</u></p>
                <p>Building off the insights we gained from the initial stages of the prototyping process, we designed a medium-fidelity <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Rdwja8WQicq4nvun7Em7og/Persuasive-Design--Breakthru.?node-id=0%3A1">Figma prototype</a> (video walkthrough <a href="https://youtu.be/Y2PCmTmz0B8">here</a>) to set the foundation for the UI/UX of our app. We completed testing with three users, and our notes from the sessions are shown below:</p>
                <p>The most important piece of feedback that we got was that the flow and order of performing tasks in the app was unclear. Users did not see the leap from the onboarding process to the break process, meaning that it was incredibly difficult to situate themselves. For this reason, we added a homepage to give the users a point of grounding, such that when they open the app they have some leeway in figuring out their plan for the day or for their current work session. More than this, it also means that they do not feel as if they are jolted into working. The main point of our application is that we do not want users to feel as if work is the most important aspect of their life, so immediately starting the work session feels counterintuitive. This extra screen makes a difference in the way we want users to make their &ldquo;breakthru.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>We also got feedback that our name itself was a little disorienting because &ldquo;breakthru&rdquo; felt overly dramatic. While we have not updated this yet or made any official changes, it was something to think about. Many people assumed &ldquo;breakthru&rdquo; was a fitness application, and while we do consider the act of doing work as a mental exercise, we are unsure if this is the direction in which we want our application to go.</p>
                <p>In terms of the actual content, we had some people that were concerned about the structure of the breaks. We decided to use a Pomodoro method initially because it helps those struggling with time management to structure their work sessions alongside their break sessions. That being said, we wanted to help people structure their breaks within a busier work day. Many students do not have the luxury of dealing with long periods of unstructured time to do their work because they often have meetings, class, or other commitments, meaning that they may need more help to find where breaks could fit in their schedule. We have talked extensively about how to incorporate Google Calendar into the application, and we feel that this idea could be the place. By incorporating the calendar into the rest of the application, we can suggest breaks during both structured work sessions and throughout the day during less traditional work sessions, such as between classes.</p>
                <p>Another large point of contention is whether or not social proof would work at all. One user we spoke to said that she would not want to be connected to other users at all, and even the idea that she would have to add her contacts would be a reason to close the application. While the feedback of a single user may not be enough to redesign our concept, we want to be more cognizant of the fact that some users want to see more intrinsic motivators. Throughout the application we wanted to show fun facts that remind users of the research of why it is a good idea to take breaks, but many users felt like these &ldquo;fun&rdquo; facts were not so fun and did not add anything to the application. To combine these ideas, we are considering replacing the fun facts with more personalized user facts. That being said, we did get a lot of validating responses about social proof: the interaction of friends was extremely exciting, that the prospect of not knowing which friend sent you what was incredibly motivating to get to the break, meaning that the motivation we have been using does have a lot of promise. Users were also impressed with the dares present, meaning that they would be motivated to participate and start the norm of taking breaks.</p>
                

                <p><u>high-fidelity prototyping</u></p>
                <p>This stage of the design process enabled us to not only take into account how we were going to specifically implement the persuasive techniques of self-affirmation and social proof, but it also helped us structure the idea of having dares/challenges and allowed us to create a more visually appealing UI. We tested our <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Rdwja8WQicq4nvun7Em7og/Persuasive-Design--balance?page-%5b&hellip;%5d48%2C0.08&amp;scaling=scale-down&amp;starting-point-node-id=136%3A1150">high-fidelity prototype</a> with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pmw7TSNi6X4_JyS2nudtU6lQSbgAKuqYocYl1Df28Lg/edit?usp=sharing">seven university students</a>. This section of user testing fell into two major categories. We were both able to test the concept by employing a Wizard of Oz testing suite by interacting with users during their work sessions and by engaging in traditional think aloud protocols. By employing both of these methods, we got feedback on the high level use of our design as well as the actual process of how users would respond to being prompted to take breaks and engage in short dares.</p>
    
                <p>Example test runs:</p>

                <p>To satisfy testing the persuasive method, we asked users to share their calendars with us, which would allow us to figure out when might be an appropriate time to take a break. We also asked users to be ready to receive text alerts from us to mimic the idea that they were being notified from our application that they should take a break. The flow was something along the lines of figuring out when they could take a break and sending them a text notification when their break arrived. The text would ask if they wanted to take a break and let them know that a friend (whose name they provided) had sent them or had responded to a dare. In one case (pictured above), we were able to coordinate two friends to take breaks together. We then waited to see if users would be tempted to open the dare/response when they were notified that it was break time.</p>
                <p>Generally, users responded very positively to these notifications. Participants enjoyed being able to engage in low-stakes but meaningful interactions with their friends while on their breaks. That said, the use of social proof seemed to play a determinant role in whether a participant committed to taking a break; several of our participants explicitly noted that they would&rsquo;ve ignored the break notification if it had not been from a friend. The act of completing and sending challenges during breaks also received positive responses. Two participants appreciated having a definitive light-hearted task to complete to give their breaks more structure and purpose, and one participant even described experiencing more focus in her next work session after completing a challenge. It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that the novelty and short-term nature of this intervention may have influenced participants&rsquo; receptiveness to it; because the probing only lasted 1-2 days, the novelty and excitement of it may have made users more likely to respond positively. That being said, not one user skipped a break over the multi-day test period, leading us to believe that these break notifications and activities may act as effective persuasive methods.</p>
                <p>We also saw that users were willing to do the dare if they were low effort. Users continually picked the least effortful dares for their friend to do. In reflection, users said that while they would never want to do a dare their friend would not do, they were scared that their friend would retaliate with a really hard dare, so they were more likely to send easy ones. Users also reflected that they appreciated the vague or nonsensical dares more than the defined dares because it allowed them to be creative with what they wanted to do. With regard to the actual content of the dares, participants appreciated that the dares were personalized to their interests. As a point of future exploration, multiple participants wanted to be able to create customized dares for their friends.</p>
                <p>Through the user testing, we got promising feedback, but there was confusion on the differences between the breaks recommended from the calendar and the breaks seen in the Pomodoro method. Some users assumed that they would only engage in the dare-oriented breaks during set work sessions, while others wanted to be told every break to take between classes and meetings and all of their other commitments. It seemed that users better with time management were less willing to commit to breaks ahead of time, since they were worried that they might be in a good &ldquo;work flow.&rdquo; That being said, in our contextual testing, we saw that users were willing to take unscheduled breaks merely because the text-prompt/app asked them to.</p>
                
                
                <p><strong>takeaways: what I learned</strong></p>
                <p>Even though I have previously done projects that have involved the process of empathizing with users, defining the problems, ideating, prototyping our ideas, and conducting user testing, Balance had a slightly different approach in the research and design phases. Here, I was not simply performing user research or designing an app, but also thinking about the psychology behind the purpose and use of the product. Learning about persuasive techniques such as self-affirmation, social proof, and priming set the foundation for our thought process throughout the project and enabled us to critically think about how we can employ these techniques to nudge our users to take breaks from their work. Additionally, from a research standpoint, conducting a focus group using the New Metaphors technique allowed for an in-depth perspective from the users, who sensed a connection to the concepts and the metaphors as university students. User research is strongly connected to psychology and deeply understanding the target population. As a UX Researcher, I learned various psychological concepts that I can carry over in future research that I do so that I can understand and empathize with my intended audience more in-depth.</p>
