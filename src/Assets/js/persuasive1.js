                        <p className='lead'>Most of our lives depend on our ability to do our work. While there is a wealth of research on work, there is no universal work strategy, and by extension, there is no universal method of taking breaks. Our project is meant to help people better their productivity and mental health by encouraging them to take a healthy amount of breaks. The end result is Balance, a social mobile app that encourages students to nominate their friends for fun mini-challenges and dares that they can participate in during their break times. This app utilizes the persuasive techniques of self-affirmation and social proof.</p>
