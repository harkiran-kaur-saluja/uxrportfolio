                        <p className='lead'>Most of our lives depend on our ability to do our work. While there is a wealth of research on work, there is no universal work strategy, and by extension, there is no universal method of taking breaks. Our project is meant to help people better their productivity and mental health by encouraging them to take a healthy amount of breaks. The end result is Balance, a social mobile app that encourages students to nominate their friends for fun mini-challenges and dares that they can participate in during their break times. This app utilizes the persuasive techniques of self-affirmation and social proof.</p>

                <p className="lead">Our background research drew our attention to the common issues surrounding work routines. Our team decided to conduct expert consultations with Mark Seery, a social psychologist from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York; Kai Crosson, a Department of Energy research psychologist in their human resources department; and Eric James, a researcher at the Metropolitan State University in Denver studying organizational communication (watched his TED Talk). Through these, we hoped to get a better understanding of how self-affirmation and social proof may help people&rsquo;s relationships with work. Our main goal was to change how people see their work and breaks by using the principles these experts study. </p>

                                Mark Seery studies how people deal with stress. We wanted his perspective on people&rsquo;s states when doing stressful work. He agreed that social proof could be used to reduce stress, and he pointed to the idea that a possible avenue of social proof would be dynamic norms.</strong>

                                <li>By saying that some percentage of one&rsquo;s friends are just starting to do something, it still holds the social proof that their friends are doing something, but it makes the goal feel less challenging because people are only just starting. This response significantly bolstered our hope that social proof could work.</li>
                                <li>A dynamic social norm can only encourage behavior change if people view the norm as likely to endure; if people view the changed norm as a brief fad, behavior is unlikely to change.</li>
